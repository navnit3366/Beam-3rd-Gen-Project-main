## Questions

1. What is the mass delta of the previous cell and the new one?
2. 

## Comments

1. The team should have a synthesis of all the tests that need to be done.
2. I should have a better balance on how I speak in terms of ho many mini comments I make.
3. Armelle: We can offer to power up the night before so that you know the status of your experiment. We just need to know before the EAR.
4. We should perform a pressure test where the piston is functional.
5. We should add the Thermal paste plans in the SED.
6. We need to somehow calculate how much the LEDs heat up the cell.
7. The USB cable of the camera should be tied to the power cable below it so that it's secured and doesn't move.
8. We should order the motor ASAP and probably order a more powerful than the one in the plans.
9. We should order the LEDs ASAP so they can be tested.
10. Update the Power Budget in chapter 6.
11. Ask Pyotr whether he can help us with the thermal and pressure sensors.
12. We should set a milestone until when we should fall back to other sensors or solutions, in case the current sensors don't work BEFORE defining whether we need to change the sensors.
13. 


## Actions

1. Implement a way where the whole timeline will go through and the motor will not work. THIS SHOULD BE COMMANDED BY THE GROUND STATION.
2. Things to be seen in the GUI:
   - The status of every component and status of the experiment and its signals (PO etc).
3. Read Giorgio's notes on suggestions what the GUI should include.
4. 

## Remember to ask

1. Except for the mode where we'll have the test running without the motor running. Should the other improvements be prioritised or should we complete other uncompleted tasks that are mandatory for the experiment to run?
