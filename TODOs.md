# Things to do

## Ground Station

- [ ] Create page for the Uplink.
- [ ] Decouple the info section so that it presents the same data everywhere without having to copy paste the code. (Have a single source of truth)
- [ ] Modify the Ground Station README to have a "How to use" section and run it by someone who has never used it before.


### IPR 2 Feedback

- [ ] The team should think about placing all information into one GUI window.
- [ ] The GUI should include the following:
  - [ ] “Health” monitoring indicators (e.g. power is received, camera is on/off, LEDs are on/off, …) to indicate that the experiment is working properly.
  - [ ] Indicators showing which rocket signals (LO, SODS, SOE) have been received.
  - [ ] The possibility to switch elements on and off remotely (e.g. heaters, led panel, camera) before starting any automatic timeline.
  - [ ] An option to “enable automatic timeline” so that after the initial checks, the “launch timeline” can start.
  - [ ] It is recommended to have different “modes” that allow the team to switch e.g. between test and flight mode.


## Rocket

- [ ] Implement the commands of the camera in Python.
- [ ] Start writing the outline of the code for the components of the rocket by just adding placeholders for the functions that will be needed.

  - [ ] CameraController
  - [X] Sensor Reading
